<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<h5>
  One of the most promising applications of character recognition in computer vision is optical character
recognition and documents monitoring which is becoming increasingly important in our daily lives and as well as in
our professional lives. Since Now also there are some forms and documents which are filled handwritten, and a
person must fill the details manually for storing on online database which is very time-consuming process. And
specially in India some people fill handwritten forms and document in their native languages which is very difficult
job for officers to recognize and understand.

<h5>
  There are some present technologies for OCR but all are generally for English handwritten text. But as in India ,
Hindi being our national language which have very complex text formations and different letters it is almost
impossible to use simple OCR. Since EasyOCR python library have an ability to recognise Hindi text from image
but with constraint that text in image should digitally printed, which is in-efficient for Hindi because people
generally prefer handwritten Hindi format in forms and documents.
